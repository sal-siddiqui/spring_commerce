## üìù Project Overview

This is my attempt at learning the **Spring Boot Framework**. I am following the [Java Spring Boot Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-using-intellij-build-a-real-world-project/) by [Faisal Memon](https://www.udemy.com/user/faisal-memon-3/).

## üß≠ Future Work

- **Explore the ["Postman Docs Playlist"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL34mf651faNJ6Wm8elGZl5mr9Zf14dWH) by [Software Testing Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/@softwaretestingmentor)**  
  I would like to learn more about using the Postman application and its features in developing and testing APIs.

- **Take the ["Spring Boot Microservices Course"](Spring Boot Microservices) by [Faisal Memon](https://www.udemy.com/user/faisal-memon-3/)**  
  I would like to learn how to develop applications using Spring Boot while applying microservices architecture principles.
